The <tt>erlang-otp</tt> packaging type assumes the standard maven directory layout while the <tt>erlang-std</tt> packaging type assumes the Erlang/OTP standard directory layout. Release projects don't have a specific directory layout (flat top level directory) since they only consist of a <tt>pom.xml</tt>, a release file, a release upgrade file and a system configuration file.</p><p>For an exact listing of directories and the supported content types please refer to the <a href="./apidocs/eu/lindenbaum/maven/PackagingType.html">PackagingType</a> documentation.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>Is there a project archetype for erlang projects?<a name="Is_there_a_project_archetype_for_erlang_projects"></a></h3><p>The plug-in does not depend on any empty directories so users don't have to create them if they don't use them (e.g. an empty <tt>priv</tt> directory). We therefore recommend that users write their own <tt>pom.xml</tt> from the start using an editor with assistance (e.g. <a href="#www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> in combination with the <a class="externalLink" href="http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/">m2eclipse</a> plug-in). After creation of the <tt>pom.xml</tt> file the <tt>setup</tt> goal may be used to setup the needed directory layout as well as default configuration files. For more information please refer to the <a href="./setup-mojo.html">setup</a> mojo documentation.</p><p>For application and release upgrade files the plug-in provides separate goals that can generate sensible template files based on previously installed/deployed project artifacts. For more information please refer to the <a href="./appup-mojo.html">appup</a> and <a href="./relup-mojo.html">relup</a> mojo documentation.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>How does the plug-in work?<a name="How_does_the_plug-in_work"></a></h3><p>The plug-in uses several erlang nodes as backends to execute scripts via remote procedure calls. The backend node will not be altered by the plug-in except for the extension of code paths. The plug-in does not need write access to the backend node's installation directory. A backend node is started and stoppend by the plug-in automatically as needed. The plug-in can re-use an already running backend node by reconnecting to it.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>Can I use Maven 3 with the plug-in?<a name="Can_I_use_Maven_3_with_the_plug-in"></a></h3><p>Yes, it is possible to run the plug-in with Maven 3 but there are some things to consider due to the <a class="externalLink" href="https://cwiki.apache.org/MAVEN/maven-3x-and-site-plugin.html"> site-plugin changes</a> that came with the Maven 3 version. These changes are important when using the reporting features of the plug-in.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>How do I manage non-erlang source code/artifacts?<a name="How_do_I_manage_non-erlang_source_codeartifacts"></a></h3><p>It is recommended to organize your project's non-erlang dependencies in separate maven projects (or at least with a separate classifier). The plug-in will put all non-erlang dependency artifacts into the application project's target <tt>priv</tt> directory. The erlang application will be able to find this directory using <tt>code:priv_dir/1</tt> at runtime as well as during test execution.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>How does the plug-in's dependency management work (roughly)?<a name="How_does_the_plug-ins_dependency_management_work_roughly"></a></h3><p>The plug-in manages the dependencies to other erlang projects packaged by this plugin. This supports modular architectures/releases featuring a whole bunch of custom applications dependening on each other. The plug-in also does not care whether your projects use different application packaging type. The available application types may be mixed up in a release or in an application's dependencies.</p><p>The plug-in is <b>not</b> intendended to manage standard Erlang/OTP application dependencies. When packaging a release it is assumed that this code is automatically available to the backend node. This is guaranteed by checking the Erlang/OTP release version running on the backend node against the required Erlang/OTP release version of a release as configured in its <tt>pom.xml</tt>.</p><p>Release projects can be seen as packaging projects that do not contain code but manage a versioned set of versioned application dependencies. Applications or releases <b>must not</b> have dependencies to other releases. Read more on this in the release packaging section.</p><p>The plug-in also respects the dependency scopes test and provided. These dependencies will not be packaged into the release and need not be contained in the application resource or release file. </p></div><div class="section"><h3>Can the plug-in run my project (and its dependencies) for testing purposes?<a name="Can_the_plug-in_run_my_project_and_its_dependencies_for_testing_purposes"></a></h3><p>Yes, the <a href="./run-mojo.html">run</a> mojo provides a convenient way to run either application projects or the applications contained in release projects (with all dependency applications) for basic testing purposes (optionally on a remote node). When running releases the project's <tt>sys.config</tt> will be loaded into the environment before starting the applications. All resource files (application <tt>priv</tt> directories) will be available to the runtime system and can be retrieved using <tt>code:priv_dir/1</tt> for a specific application. The plug-in will give an advice about how to connect to the (remote) node running the application(s). </p></div><div class="section"><h3>Does the plug-in suppport structured source directories?<a name="Does_the_plug-in_suppport_structured_source_directories"></a></h3><p>Yes, the plug-in supports structured source directories. All recursively found modules will be compiled and the resulting <tt>.beam</tt> objects will be put flattened into the targets <tt>ebin</tt> directory.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>Does the plug-in support private include files (that won't be shipped)?<a name="Does_the_plug-in_support_private_include_files_that_wont_be_shipped"></a></h3><p>Yes, the root source folder of a project is added to the include path during compilation. This may be used for private header files (e.g. testing purposes) that will not be packaged along.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>How should the application's include files be used?<a name="How_should_the_applications_include_files_be_used"></a></h3><p>An application should include its include files as if they were placed in the same directory as the including source. The plug-in will pull in the needed include directives for compilation automatically. Alternatively, the <tt>-include_lib</tt> directive can be used for the applications includes as well as the dependency applications includes. This has the advantage that one can see directly which application provides the specific include. However, the <tt>-include_lib</tt> directive can not be applied to private header files as described in the section above.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>How does the plug-in deal with resources and test resources?<a name="How_does_the_plug-in_deal_with_resources_and_test_resources"></a></h3><p>The plug-in supports random resources that will be put into the target <tt>priv</tt> directory. Resources from the test priv directory will override the default resources in the test phase. The <tt>priv</tt> directory can be obtained at test runtime using <tt>code:priv_dir/1</tt>. </p></div><div class="section"><h3>How does the plug-in support unit testing?<a name="How_does_the_plug-in_support_unit_testing"></a></h3><p>Unless specified otherwise the plugin executes all modules with the suffix <tt>_test</tt> or <tt>_tests</tt> as <tt>eunit</tt> tests. Tests may be skipped using the <tt>skipTests</tt> paramter. To execute only a specific test the parameter <tt>test</tt> can be used (in fact the plug-in even executes test modules placed in the application's main source directory).</p><p>When test execution was successful the plugin provides surefire compatible reports about test runs that will automatically be found by the maven surefire plugin on site generation.</p><p>The plug-in also provides the possibility to generate test coverage reports with annotated source code listing (as you may know them from tools like <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.eclemma.org/">eclemma</a>) and/or with console output. See the <a href="./examples/coverage.html">coverage</a> example page for further information about that.</p><p>To run only a single test module the <tt>test</tt> parameter can be set to a specific test module.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>How to debug a broken unit test?<a name="How_to_debug_a_broken_unit_test"></a></h3><p>Debugging broken unit tests can sometimes be a hard thing. Therefore debugging should be made directly from the erlang console where you can use all that shiny <tt>dbg</tt> stuff erlang has to offer. The plug-in can support that by uploading all needed modules (tests and project modules compiled with debug information) to a specified node. The <a href="./upload-tests-mojo.html">upload-tests</a> goal will upload everything you need to an (already started) node the user can run/debug tests on. A lightweight alternative to re-running the unit tests on a separate node could be to examine the output of the backend nodes which is written to the file <tt>target/backend.log</tt>.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>How does application packaging of <tt>erlang-otp</tt> and <tt>erlang-std</tt> projects work?<a name="How_does_application_packaging_of_erlang-otp_and_erlang-std_projects_work"></a></h3><p>The plug-in will package your application according to the OTP design principles (e.g. the package will make use of the OTP directory layout). This can be seen when inspecting the <tt>target</tt> directory after a run of <tt>mvn package</tt>. The dependency artifacts are <tt>.tar.gz</tt> packages of the created directory structure. The needed erlang application file can/should be written by the user but the plug-in may support the user by providing application packaging variables that will expand to sensible values when packaging the application.</p><p>The <tt>$<a name="MODULES">MODULES</a></tt> variable for example expands to a list of modules the application delivers. This us useful for the <tt>modules</tt> tuple in the application resource file inspected by the erlang release handler.</p><p>Another example is the <tt>$<a name="REGISTERED">REGISTERED</a></tt> variable. This will interact with the <tt>-registered([...]).</tt> attribute and expand to a list of names registered by an application at runtime.</p><p>The <tt>$<a name="APPLICATIONS">APPLICATIONS</a></tt> variable will expand to a listing of (transitive) application dependencies an application has based on the specified maven dependencies.</p><p>For a list of available application packaging variables see the <a href="./plugin-configuration.html">plugin configuration</a> page.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>How does the plug-in deal with library applications?<a name="How_does_the_plug-in_deal_with_library_applications"></a></h3><p>It simply doesn't do anything special with them. Library applications are packaged like any other application project since the only difference to other applications is that the <tt>mod</tt> tuple in its application resource file is omitted. The <tt>sasl</tt> application can handle that so calls to <tt>application:start/1</tt> and <tt>application:stop/1</tt> can be made without any problems.</p><p>We've heard of people recommending to put library dependencies into the <tt>included_application</tt> tuple and package the code along with the using application. The <tt>included_application</tt> tuple is intended only for applications that will be included in another applications supervision tree manually. We recommend to separate your applications properly and write correct, simple application resource files.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>How does release packaging of <tt>erlang-rel</tt> projects work?<a name="How_does_release_packaging_of_erlang-rel_projects_work"></a></h3><p>The plug-in will package your release according to the OTP design principles into a <tt>.tar.gz</tt> package that can be installed by the erlang release handler. The needed erlang release file can/should be written by the user but the plug-in may support the user by providing release packaging variables that will expand to sensible values when building the release.</p><p>Because dependencies to applications have to be resolved (to versions) at this point the release must be built on a backend node that can deliver the required versions of applications. The maven dependencies (applications packaged by the plug-in) will be put into the code paths automatically by the plug-in. Standard Erlang/OTP applications will be taken from the backend node's code path.</p><p>The <tt>$<a name="APPLICATIONS">APPLICATIONS</a></tt> and <tt>$<a name="AUTODEPS">AUTODEPS</a></tt> variables expand to all transitive maven dependencies as required by the release files applications section and will also put in the required transitive dependencies to standard Erlang/OTP applications (e.g. mnesia, sasl, ...). The version of the standard applications are those available to the backend node. To achieve a correct dependency management a release project must configure what Erlang/OTP release should be used as release base (the standard application versions will then be taken from this release). The build will fail if either the OTP release base variable (<tt>otpRelease</tt>) is not configured or the backend node does not run the configured release.</p><p>To be able to make a test build with another OTP release version the user may specify the <tt>skipReleaseTest</tt> parameter to skip the OTP release verification. The release will then pull in the standard erlang applications from another OTP release (that is currently run by the backend node).</p><p>In summary, this means that if you decide to create your release based on the applications of <tt>R13B04</tt> your backend node must actually run this version of erlang. This can be achieved by building your release on a central build server like <a class="externalLink" href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">jenkins/hudson</a> or by having the suitable release installed locally. It is possible to specify the used <tt>erl</tt> command using the <tt>erlCommand</tt> parameter.</p><p>For a list of available release packaging variables see the <a href="./plugin-configuration.html">plugin configuration</a> page.</p><p>In case the plug-in support is disclaimed the user has to take care of the availability of the required versions of standard applications. This can be achieved by specifying the <tt>skipReleaseTest</tt> parameter and adding the needed applications to the code path of the backend node manually. Applications found in paths prepended to the code path will override later entries.</p><p>On top of that the plug-in will generate the necessary scripts to package with the release (e.g. <tt>.boot</tt> file, ...). Finally the plug-in preforms some checks on the project's resource files.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>Does the plug-in support the edoc application overview file?<a name="Does_the_plug-in_support_the_edoc_application_overview_file"></a></h3><p>The EDoc application overview is supported by the edoc report mojo. While in <tt>erlang-otp</tt> projects the file <tt>overview.edoc</tt> has to be located in the <tt>src/site</tt> directory, in <tt>erlang-std</tt> project will expect the file in the <tt>doc</tt> directory. The packaging variables <tt>${ARTIFACT}</tt>, <tt>${DESCRIPTION}</tt>, <tt>${ID}</tt> and <tt>${VERSION}</tt> are available to the overview file and may be used accordingly.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>How to deal with non-maven packaged erlang projects?<a name="How_to_deal_with_non-maven_packaged_erlang_projects"></a></h3><p>To make non-maven packaged 3rd party erlang applications available to other application or release projects <a href="./team-list.html">Gregory Haskins</a> wrote the nifty escript <tt>eapp2mvn</tt> to deploy these artifacts under configurable maven coordinates. The script's documentation is self-contained. The script can be found in the <a class="externalLink" href="https://erlang-plugin.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/erlang-plugin/trunk/maven-erlang-plugin/tools/">tools</a> directory of the plug-in's source code repository.</p></div></div>
