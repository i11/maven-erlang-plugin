The Maven Erlang Plug-In
========================

This plug-in for Maven makes it very easy to build, test, package and deploy
Erlang applications and projects. It manages dependencies and artifacts and
allows for trouble-free integration with existing software development
infrastructure.

Release packaging - this plug-in does it! Combine library- and OTP-applications
into release systems and upgrade packages that can be used directly with the
Erlang release handling tools. Deployment and system upgrade can't be easier.

Latest release
--------------

__2012-05-04__:
[Maven Erlang Plug-In version 2.2.0](http://lindenbaum.github.com/maven-erlang-plugin/2.2.0/).
This third release adds some more fixes and improvements. We now have over a
year of experience, with the plug-in in day-to-day use, and it's proven to be
reliable and efficient. Building, packaging and managing dependencies can't be
easier. Read the full list of
[changes](http://lindenbaum.github.com/maven-erlang-plugin/2.2.0/changes-report.html)
for more information.

Now we really want to make the plugin, and the use of dependencies simpler and
more easily available to other Erlang/OTP developers. Also, we made some
third party Erlang/OTP applications and libraries available in the
[Sonatype OSS Repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/index.html#nexus-search;quick~eu.lindenbaum.thirdparty*).

__Enjoy!__
